# hello-world
learning github repository

I wanna learn more coding and stuff, but i also want to make a game one day so this is a new step for me.
even though i graduated with a computer science degree, i still feel like i know nothing of programming
or development.
Man, learning more advanced code and web-development techniques is so daunting and scary.
but the learning process in the longrun will be beneficial to me
